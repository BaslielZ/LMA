# Life Management App

## Features

1. **Dashboard:** for quick actions and viewing  
2. **To-Do List:** Like a Kanban board with In-Progress and Completed lists. With labels and prioritization.  
3. **Note Taking:** Quick note-taking tab  
4. **Weather:** Using open API. Possibly add a forecast and recommend activity based on it.  
5. **Goals:** A goal can have many tasks to achieve it. Somehow make these tasks linked to the To-Do List for easy drag and drop. And show goal progress based on that.

## File Architecture

**MVVM** â€” because it is the most common to use when development is feature-based.  
But still undecided.

## Data Storage

**JSON** (at least for this MVP)
